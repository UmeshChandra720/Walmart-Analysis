Walmart Customer Behavior Analysis

About the Project
This project focuses on understanding how Walmart customers behave when making purchases. We analyzed data based on gender, marital status, and age to find patterns and trends in their spending habits.

Goals
Study how different groups of customers (like men, women, married, single) spend money.
Use simple statistical methods to get insights from the data.
Create visuals to make the findings easy to understand.

Tools and Methods
Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Techniques Used: Confidence intervals and Central Limit Theorem

Data Details
The dataset has the following columns:
Gender: Male or Female
Marital Status: Single or Married
Age: Age of the customer
Purchase: How much they spent

Insights
1. Gender: We found out how men and women spend differently.
2. Marital Status: Checked if being married affects how much people spend.
3. Age: Looked at which age groups spend the most.

Visuals
Created bar charts, pie charts, and histograms to show the results clearly.

Suggestions
Focus marketing on the groups that spend the most.
Give special offers for different age or gender groups to increase sales.
Keep products that are popular among high-spending groups in stock.
